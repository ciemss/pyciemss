Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model.\nMethods: A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number Rc, as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), of the disease transmission in mainland China excluding Hubei province.\nResults: The estimation outcomes indicate that the control reproduction number is 3.36 (95% CI 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dropped below 1 since January 31st, 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in mainland China excluding Hubei province are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we proved that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020.\nConclusions: To ensure the epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April. If all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected to be ended by April in mainland China apart from Hubei province.</p>","author":[{"name":"Hui Wan"},{"name":"Jing-an Cui"},{"name":"Guo-Jing Yang"}],"pages":"","number":"","identifier":[{"type":"doi","id":"10.1101/2020.03.01.20029629"}],"year":"2020","citation_list":[{"volume":"201","journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","year":"2020","first_page":"7","title":"Novel Wuhan (2019-nCoV) Coronavirus","doi":"10.1164/rccm.2014P7"},{"unstructured_citation":"National Health Commission of China;.

Here, this problem is addressed using a metapopulation approach to show that the delay in the transmission of the spread between different subsets of the total population, can be incorporated into a SIR framework through a time-dependent transmission rate. Thus, the reproduction number decreases with time despite the population dynamics remains uniform and the depletion of susceptible individuals is small. The obtained results are consistent with the early subexponential growth observed in the cumulated number of confirmed cases even in the absence of containment measures. We validate our model by describing the evolution of the COVID-19 using real data from different countries with an emphasis in the case of Mexico and show that it describes correctly also the long-time dynamics of the spread. The proposed model yet simple is successful at describing the onset and progression of the outbreak and considerably improves accuracy of predictions over traditional compartmental models.

Yet there are no generally accepted methods to consistently estimate the relative magnitude of the change in transmissiblity of newly emerging variants. In this paper we consider three methods for examining and quantifying positive selection of new and emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2 over an existing wild-type strain. We consider replication at the level of countries and allow for the action of other processes that can change variants9 frequencies, specifically migration and drift. We apply these methods to the D614G spike mutation and the variant designated B.1.1.7, in every country where there is sufficient sequence data. For each of D614G and B.1.1.7, we find evidence for strong selection (greater than 25% increased contagiousness) in more than half of countries analyzed. Our results also shows that the selective advantages of these strains are highly heterogeneous at the country level, suggesting the need for a truly global perspective on the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.</p>","author":[{"name":"Christiaan H van Dorp"},{"name":"Emma E Goldberg"},{"name":"Nicolas Hengartner"},{"name":"Ruian Ke"},{"name":"Ethan Obie Romero-Severson"}],"pages":"","number":"","identifier":[{"type":"doi","id":"10.1101/2021.03.29.21254233"}],"year":"2021"},{"type":"fulltext","_gddid":"626e97362688b711350f7f20","title":"Modeling the Effects of Meteorological Factors and Unreported Cases on Seasonal Influenza Outbreaks in Gansu Province, China","volume":"82","journal":"Bulletin of Mathematical Biology","link":[{"url":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11538-020-00747-6","type":"publisher"}],"publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","abstract":"","author":[{"name":"Jing, Shuang-Lin"},{"name":"Huo, Hai-Feng"},{"name":"Xiang, Hong"}],"pages":"","number":"6","identifier":[{"type":"doi","id":"10.1007/s11538-020-00747-6"}],"year":"2020"},{"type":"fulltext","_gddid":"616d805367467f7269cf208e","title":"The spread and control of rumors in a multilingual environment","volume":"100","journal":"Nonlinear Dynamics","link":[{"url":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11071-020-05621-7","type":"publisher"}],"publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","abstract":"","author":[{"name":"Yu, Shuzhen"},{"name":"Yu, Zhiyong"},{"name":"Jiang, Haijun"},{"name":"Mei, Xuehui"},{"name":"Li, Jiarong"}],"pages":"2933--2951","number":"3","identifier":[{"type":"doi","id":"10.1007/s11071-020-05621-7"}],"year":"2020"},{"type":"fulltext","_gddid":"63c8e13474bed2df5c93a54a","title":"Are European natural gas markets connected?

Initially, case numbers expanding exponentially with doubling times of ~1-2 weeks. In the nations where lockdowns were not implemented or ineffectual, case numbers increased exponentially but then stabilized around 102-to-103 new infections (per km2 built-up area per day).

We were able to test this approach by comparing the approximated \"herd immunity\" to the vaccination coverage observed that corresponded to rapid declines in community infections during 2021. The estimates reported here agree with the observed phenomena.

Several efforts of modelling of the geo-temporal transmissibility of the virus have been undertaken, but none describes the incorporation of effect of seasonality, contact density, primary care and ICU bed capacity and behavioural risk reduction measures such as lockdowns into the simulation modeling for Pakistan. We use above variables to create a close to real data curve function for the active cases of covid-19 in Pakistan.\nObjective: The objective of this study was to create a new computational epidemiological model for Pakistan by implementing symptomatology, healthcare capacity and behavioural risk reduction mathematically to predict of Covid-19 case trends and effects of changes in community characteristics and policy measures.\nMethods: We used a modified version of SEIR model called SEIDRD (Susceptible - Exposed Latent - Diagnosed as Mild or severe - Recovered - Deaths). This was developed using Vensim PLE software version 8.0. This model also incorporated the seasonal and capacity variables for Pakistan and was adjusted for behavioural risk reduction measures such as lockdowns. \nResults: The SEIDRD model was able to closely replicate the active covid-19 cases curve function for Pakistan until now. It was able to show that given current trends, though the number of active cases are dropping, if the smart lockdown measures were to end, the cases are expected to show a rise from 28th August 2020 onwards reaching a second peak around 28th September 2020. It was also seen that increasing the ICU bed capacity in Pakistan from 4000 to 40000 will not make a significant difference in active case number. Another simulation for a vaccination schedule of 100000 vaccines per day was created which showed a decrease in covid cases in a slow manner over a period of months rather than days.\nConclusion: This study attempts to successfully model the active covid-19 cases curve function of Pakistan and mathematically models the effect of seasonality, contact density, ICU bed availability and Lockdown measures. We were able to show the effectiveness of smart lockdowns and were also to predict that in case of no smart lockdowns, Pakistan can see a rise in active case number starting from 28th of August 2020.</p>","author":[{"name":"Shoab Saadat"},{"name":"Salman Mansoor"},{"name":"Ammad Fahim"}],"pages":"","number":"","identifier":[{"type":"doi","id":"10.1101/2020.09.01.20182642"}],"year":"2020","citation_list":[{"doi":"10.1101/2020.03.21.20040444"},{"doi":"10.7326/M20-0504"},{"doi":"10.1093/aje/kwh255"},{"unstructured_citation":"COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan - Wikipedia [Internet].
